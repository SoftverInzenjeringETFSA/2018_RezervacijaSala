# Getting started
In ./App run

    yarn install-all
Keep in mind, this requires **concurrently** to be installed globally. To install concurrently run

    npm i -g concurrently
 Otherwise, you can go in both folders, server and client and run 
 

    yarn install

To start server do

    yarn server
If you have **nodemon** installed globally you can do

    yarn server-dev
To start client do

    yarn client
To start server and client at the same time you can do

    yarn start
Note: This also requires concurrently.
